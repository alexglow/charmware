modular tech jewelry // pcbs for building custom wearable electronic circuits. Check out the full write-up at http://bit.ly/charmware !

## usage
I would recommend NOT building these yet, since they will go through a few more iterations before I'm comfortable encouraging others to use them. But feel free to download, for your own curiosity or to play around with! <3

## fab guidelines
Recommend ordering these in half-height (0.8mm) from Osh Park. :)
